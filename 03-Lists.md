# Lists

In Markdown, you can create both unordered and ordered lists to organize information. Additionally, you can use task lists to track tasks or progress. Let's explore these list types:

## 1. Unordered Lists

Create an unordered list using asterisks (`*`), plus signs (`+`), or hyphens (`-`) followed by a space.

Example:

- Item 1: `* Item 1`
- Item 2: `+ Item 2`
- Item 3: `- Item 3`

## 2. Ordered Lists

Create an ordered list using numbers followed by a period and a space.

Example:

1. Item 1: `1. Item 1`
2. Item 2: `2. Item 2`
3. Item 3: `3. Item 3`

## 3. Task Lists

Create a task list by using square brackets with a space for completed tasks (`[x]`) and an empty space for incomplete tasks (`[ ]`).

Example:

- [x] Task 1: `- [x] Task 1`
- [ ] Task 2: `- [ ] Task 2`
- [ ] Task 3: `- [ ] Task 3`

Remember to escape backticks within code blocks by replacing them with a backslash (`\`) to display properly.

## 4. Definition Lists

Create definition lists using colons (`:`) 

Term 1
: Definition 1

```txt
Term 2
: Definition 2
```

These list types provide flexibility for structuring content in a readable and organized manner. Explore and use them according to your documentation needs!
